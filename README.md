# Python Learning Notes (Data Science Edition) 📘🐍

## Hello! 🎉

Welcome to my Python learning repository!

Here, I’ve documented everything I’ve learned throughout my Python journey — especially with a focus on **data science**. This repo includes core concepts, practical examples, and real coding exercises that I encountered during hands-on learning.

My goal is to reinforce my own understanding and also help other learners navigating the same path.

## 📎 Notes

This repository is both a **personal learning archive** and a **reference hub** for beginner-to-intermediate Python learners interested in data science.

The `notebooks/` folder contains Jupyter notebooks with commented code and markdown explanations.

🔗 **Note**: Example datasets are either publicly available or included as CSVs in the `datasets/` folder.
