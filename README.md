# Python Learning Notes

## Hello! ðŸŽ‰

In this repository, I'm sharing the notes I took throughout my Python learning journey. These notes cover the fundamental concepts and applications of the Python programming language. My goal is to reinforce my own learning by documenting what Iâ€™ve learned and also to support other learners who are on a similar path.

Throughout the notes, youâ€™ll also find examples and snippets from real coding exercises and challenges I encountered during my learning process.
